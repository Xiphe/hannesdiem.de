> I invite you to gently close your eyes  
> And now take a deep breath in through your nose  
> And out through your mouth  
> And tune into your body  
> Letting everything outside of you slowely fade away
>
> Now imagine

There is a misty place hidden in the midst of your chest  
Where the sun is casting runes though branches  
A bird is telling stories from the peace of their nest  
While your peripheral vision enhances

There is soft moss caressing your tingling soles  
And a hazy calm fog so enchanting  
As a warm breeze blows and a golden light glows  
All life's shades begin dancing

There&apos;s a cool, clear pool, in this emerald scene  
With a promise of depth, inviting  
Embrace the mystery, dive into the unseen  
For the heart of the water's exciting

**Take your time, take your time, take your time**  
**To dissolve in yourself**  
**To resolve yourself**

> You're doing great!  
> Focussing inwards  
> Relaxing your neck, your eyebrows, your jaw  
> Allowing yourself to fall deeper and deeper into the sound  
> Let it wash over you like an ocean wave
>
> And imagine

There&apos;s a drowned world within you, unseen and serene  
Where azure dreams ripple, reflected  
A twilight realm where reality seems to lean  
As your mind feels deeply connected

There&apos;s a sunken tale spun in the oceans grand  
Where shadow and light entwine  
And a coral canvas, brushed by nature&apos;s hand  
As your thoughts and feelings align

In the abyss, a pearl of possibility shines  
Its glow, a gentle lullaby, soothing  
Upon closer look, a universal design  
A celestial sphere in the deep, inducing

**Take your time, take your time, take your time**  
**To dissolve in yourself**  
**To resolve yourself**

There&apos;s an endless space expanding from the core of your soul  
And a million lights dancing on a cosmic patrol  
For among the stardust, your stories are whole  
As your higher self wakes and unfolds its role

**Take your time, take your time, take your time**  
**To dissolve in yourself**  
**To resolve yourself**

> In a few moments  
> Come back, gently  
> In your own time  
> Please open your eyes
>
> And notice: What is different now?
