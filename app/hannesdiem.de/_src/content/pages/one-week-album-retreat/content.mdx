## What's gonna happen?

A week of inner work, group building, creative practice and music making.  
Together we transform a group of strangers into an orchestra bursting with ideas.

- We build an appreciative band of trust and support within the group
- We establish techniques to quickly communicate our raw creative ideas
- We tap into our unconscious inspiration
- We wield our emotions into sound
- We practice rituals of actualization

**This unforgettable experience fosters true connections and the creation of fresh, raw, and authentic music.**

### Hannes

Greeted into this world with the soulful blues music of his father he grew up with instruments and music all around him and learned to play drums, percussion and piano at a young age.

At age 17 he recorded his first progressive metal album and from there on journeys through the genres from gothic over rap, singer-songwriter and alternative to electronic music.  
2022 and counting he is coming up with over 356 song ideas per year when doing livestream improvisation sessions where he transmutes emotions to sounds.

For over 6 years he has been living in his Campervan and practicing a digital nomad lifestyle.  
Despite living "the dream" at marvelous places, working remotely, surfing and partying, he had increasing difficulties accessing his musical roots and eventually faced a series of severe depressive episodes.  
These times of darkness and struggle ultimately led him on a path of recalibrating beliefs, befriending shadows, and finding new ways to grow. Similar to his fluidity in genres he values approaches from conventional movement and psychotherapy as well as breathwork, yoga, tantra and more.

**It's this careful mixture of inner work and musical expression that he is inviting you in. Come and join a dance between bliss and anger, between tears and laughter, between industrial and funk.**

### Roxanna

born in 1988, she lives in Hamburg or in her van somewhere between Denmark and Spain.

She studied business administration and cultural management. She has worked in marketing and event management for the last 15 years.

In search of freedom, reflection on the essentials and the sea, she shares her stories. Her passions are writing and cooking. She has spent a lot of time at the sea and has a fable for Scandinavian culture. Her buttermilk-yellow vintage car "Susy" has become a complex attitude to life and an engine of thought. If there's enough wind, she'll be kitesurfing.

**In this week she will be our feel good partner, supporting where it's useful, creating the meals, holding the space or as an active listener to everybody who needs one.
Her vision for the retreat is: Lagom. It describes a deeply Swedish attitude to life and means “not too much, not too little”, or “just right”.**

## The location

We meet in a cozy, hygge location that's about feeling comfortable. Our creations will take place in a living room, the kitchen or in the garden and we're gonna capture that vibe when we record.

Our accommodation is a former farmer yard with two 3-person bedrooms and 2 rooms with double beds and a shared bathroom. It has a sauna, a dining hall, an activity room and a hang-out area with a fireplace as well as endless access to nature. The beach is 1 km away.

Løkken is an old, small fishing town. Løkken's beach is lined with a beautiful dune landscape, which becomes rougher as you go north and turns into a cliff. Small bathing houses decorate the sandy beach.

## FAQ

### How much does this cost?

Løkken: **350€** for everything.

This amount includes overnight accommodation and three meals per day for the entire week.
We do not calculate our own effort for preparing, carrying out, cooking, leading, etc. at this first event, because we continuously learn and are committed to this.

Instead of a fee we would like to receive your honest feedback and create photo and video material of the event so we can communicate it better in the future.

### Will we actually write a full album?

We'll see! The intent is an invitation to create a strong focus and a motivation to go through resistances. A clear goal serves as a catalyst to do the work necessary and we will harness that.

At the same time: If this creates negative stress such as incentivizing people to work during the night, we'll take a step back. This week is about discovery and connection as much as it's about creativity.
