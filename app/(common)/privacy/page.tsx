          The <strong>security and privacy of your</strong> data is extremely
          important to me!
          <br />
          Preferably, I don&apos;t want to have any data from you at all.
          <br />
          <br />
          That&apos;s why I do not store, process or collect any personal data.
          <br />
          <br />
          For some functions I use cookies. But never to track you.

              Cookies themselves are not evil, unfortunately they are just used
              by many companies nowadays to track users. I do not track you.

              <br />
              What I do for example is: When you pre-save a track on Spotify or
              Deezer I will store an encryption code in your browser that
              ensures that I can only use your Spotify login when you are
              interacting with the site ‚Äì many other pages don&apos;t do this,
