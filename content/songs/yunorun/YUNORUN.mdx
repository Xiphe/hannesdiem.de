You're a ten dimensional machinery  
You're an engine fluctuating between form and fantasy  
Ten thousand gears and pinions grinding day and night  
And an insomniac compass navigating though the fright

All the levers stand at full tilt all the time  
By now they're barely movable by all the rust and all the grime  
And relentlessly you target every peak  
Your only option seems: Continue being on a streak!

And through the groaning and the teeming  
You hear a thousand voices screaming  
Are you insane? What are you doing? Where are you going?

Why the fuck ain't you running? Ain't you running, ain't you running? Running home.

Through impassable realms you creep ahead  
The drainers come and gorge and the doubters swarm and spread  
Every warning sign, you swiftly brush aside  
With a faint determined will and a heart of pain and pride

And through the groaning and the teeming  
You hear a thousand voices screaming  
Are you insane? What are you doing? Where are you going?

Why the fuck ain't you running? Ain't you running, ain't you running? Running home.
